### API Endpoints
- `/api/courses/*`: Course data operations
- `/api/user-profile`: Profile management
- `/api/requirements/*`: Requirement calculations
- `/api/semesters`: Semester planning
- `/api/course-completions`: Completion tracking
- `/api/security/*`: Security monitoring
- `/api/admin/*`: Admin operations

## Security & Compliance

### FERPA Compliance

- Debounced search inputs
- Memoized expensive calculations
- Skeleton loading states

## Key Components

### Layout Components
- `AppLayout`: Main application wrapper with navigation
- `Header`: Top navigation bar
- `Sidebar`: Side navigation menu

### Feature Components
- `PlannerGrid`: Drag-and-drop course planning
- `RequirementsDashboard`: Degree progress tracking
- `CourseExplorer`: Course search and filtering
- `Dashboard`: Student overview dashboard
- `ProfileSetup`: Onboarding wizard

### UI Components (GT Design System)
- Form components with validation
- Modal system with accessibility
- Card components with consistent styling
- Chart components with GT theming
- Loading and error states

## Development Workflow

### Commands
- `npm run dev`: Start development server with Turbopack
- `npm run build`: Production build
- `npm run lint`: Run ESLint
- `npm start`: Start production server

### Environment Variables
Required in `.env.local`:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

## Project Status

### Completed Features
- Full authentication flow with Google OAuth
- Complete course planning interface
- Degree requirement tracking system
- Course explorer with advanced search
- Student dashboard with analytics
- Profile setup wizard
- Security monitoring system
- FERPA compliance implementation

### Recent Cleanup (August 2025)
- Removed test files and debug components
- Cleaned unused Jest dependencies
- Removed temporary migration files
- Optimized package.json
- Cleared development artifacts

### Known Issues (Minor)
- Some TypeScript warnings in lint output
- Unused imports in a few components
- Minor type inconsistencies in API routes

## Architecture Decisions

### Why Next.js App Router
- Server Components for better performance
- Built-in API routes
- Excellent TypeScript support
- Optimized bundling with Turbopack

### Why Supabase
- Built-in authentication
- Real-time capabilities
- Row Level Security
- PostgreSQL with full SQL support

### Why Zustand + React Query
- Zustand for simple client state
